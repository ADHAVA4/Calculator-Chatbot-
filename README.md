# Calculator-Chatbot-
Calculator Chatbot created using RASA<br><br>
<b><h3>Expected Workflow:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Greetings 
<li>User gives the input for the operations to perform.Eg: Add/subtract or anything related.
<li>Bot asks for the input for first number 
<li>User gives the input
<li>Bot asks for the input for second number
<li>User gives the input
<li>Bot gives the answer
<li>This cycle is repeated till user exits the bot


There are bugs in the code because of which the calculator bot is accepting input infinitely and not moving ahead to perform calculations.<br><br>
